              Students receive daily instruction in theater, dance, music, and
              visual arts, and lessons in these subjects are integrated into the
              academic curriculum. We strive to serve as a model that encourages
              creativity and innovation in the classroom and inspires students
              to develop the intellectual and personal fortitude to realize
              their dreams.

                We believe access to artistic expression has the power to
                transform lives, and at Bronx Arts Elementary, it is a priority
                that every student has that opportunity. Our responsive
                classrooms ensure students are engaged and supported through
                social-emotional learning and meaningful relationships.
                Rigorous, engaging, and relevant curriculum encourages students
                to be creative and collaborative as they expand their critical
                thinking skills to immerse themselves in the discovery of new
                ideas.

                We strongly believe that all students deserve the opportunity to
                demonstrate excellence and that all children can and will

                Our Inclusion Program provides students with special needs the
                opportunity to be educated in a general education environment
                with supplemental support, and our commitment to meeting the
                instructional needs of all students is further supported by
                small class size and a school day that is thirty minutes longer
                than that of most schools.
