          We believe access to artistic expression has the power to transform lives, and at Bronx Arts Elementary, it is a priority that every student has that opportunity. Our responsive classrooms ensure students are engaged and supported through social-emotional learning and meaningful relationships. Rigorous, engaging, and relevant curriculum encourages students to be creative and collaborative as they expand their critical thinking skills to immerse themselves in the discovery of new ideas.
